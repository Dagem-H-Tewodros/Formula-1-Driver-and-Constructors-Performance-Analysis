# Formula 1 Data Project

## Overview
Welcome to my Formula 1 data project! I set out to explore the fascinating world of F1 by diving into a rich dataset that spans from 1950 to 2023. My goal was to uncover insights about driver and team performances, race strategies, and more by building an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## What I Did

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - I grabbed a comprehensive F1 dataset from Kaggle that includes everything from race results to driver and team stats. You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/path-to-dataset).

2. **Data Structuring**
   - Imported all the CSV files into MySQL to keep things organized and make analysis easier.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Spent some time cleaning up the data: fixing missing values, standardizing formats, and getting rid of duplicates to ensure everything was accurate and consistent.

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed championship standings to find out which drivers and teams dominated over the years.
   - Looked into how performance varied across different circuits and compared qualifying results with race outcomes.
   - Explored pit stop strategies and the effects of sprint qualifying sessions on race results.

5. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Created a Power BI dashboard that’s interactive and easy to use.
   - Features include a timeline of key events, profiles of drivers and teams, performance visuals for different tracks, and dynamic views of race results and qualifying performances. You can explore the Power BI dashboard [here](#) *(Link to be inserted later)*.

## Key Takeaways
- Discovered periods of dominance by certain teams and drivers.
- Identified trends in how different tracks affect performance.
- Gained insights into the importance of pit stops and how sprint qualifying sessions can shift race strategies.

## Wrap-Up
This project showed me just how much data can reveal about Formula 1. The Power BI dashboard I created offers a fun and interactive way to explore the sport’s history and performance details.

## Next Steps
- Plan to expand the dataset with more recent seasons.
- Consider adding more metrics, like weather conditions and detailed driver stats.

Feel free to check out the dashboard and dive into the exciting world of F1 data!
